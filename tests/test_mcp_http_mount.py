"""Integration smoke tests for the MCP HTTP transport.

Tests that ``combine_lifespans`` correctly wires both the app lifespan and
the MCP lifespan, that tool wrappers read ``routes.*`` singletons at call
time (not at module load), and that the mount is present.  Each test builds
a minimal FastAPI app that mirrors the Phase-C wiring pattern from
``main.py``.

The FastMCP ``Client`` connects in-process via ``FastMCPTransport``, so
it does not send HTTP requests through the mounted ASGI sub-app.  The
test instead validates the three critical concerns:

1.  ``combine_lifespans(app_lifespan, mcp_app.lifespan)`` — the combined
    lifespan is entered manually and both sub-lifespans run.
2.  The tools callable via ``Client`` read ``routes.*`` that were set by
    ``app_lifespan``, proving the lazy-read contract.
3.  The ``app.mount("/mcp", mcp_app)`` is present in the route table and
    responds (via GET redirect) without a 404.
